# Introduction

Welcome to the AcceptOn's API! Our API is heavily inspired by [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
All responses from our API should be returned in [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.
Please only use HTTPS to ensure data privacy, otherwise, we will send flying monkeys to hunt you down.
Beware the monkeys! Seriously, they hurt.

Available client libraries:

* [Ruby](https://github.com/accepton/accepton-ruby)
* [Python](https://github.com/accepton/accepton-python)
* More to come Real Soon Now, pinky swear!

# Environments

In order to allow for testing, the AcceptOn API is available in the following locations:

* Staging: https://staging-checkout.accepton.com
* Production: https://checkout.accepton.com

The staging environment should be used for testing. Please keep in mind that
the data can be deleted at any time.

To actually process payments, the production environment must be used.
To switch to production, simply update the URL and corresponding API KEY,
and if the moon is in the right (meaning both correct and directional) quadrant of the sky, it should "Just Work"!

# Getting Started

First, you'll need to create an account and retrieve your API credentials:

1. If you haven't done so already, please create an account in the Staging environment
[https://staging.accepton.com/sign_up](https://staging.accepton.com/sign_up)
1. Link a payment processor such as Stripe or Braintree
1. Retrieve your API key here: [https://staging.accepton.com/admin/user/profile](https://staging.accepton.com/admin/user/profile)

Next, create a payment form that you'll use to collect payment:

1. Click "Create a Form" in the bottom left area of the navigation
1. Copy and paste the generated code to your site

Then, make your first transaction using the form:

1. Generate a [transaction token](#create-a-transaction-token)
1. Pass the id attribute of the response (aka the token) into the configuration of the AcceptOn form
1. Profit!

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
curl "https://staging-checkout.accepton.com/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API KEY>"
```

```ruby
require 'accepton-ruby'

environment = :production
client = AcceptOn::Client.new(api_key: API_KEY, environment: environment)
```

```python
from accepton import Client

client = Client(api_key=API_KEY, environment='staging')
```

AcceptOn requires an API key to gain access to, well, the actual API. After logging into accepton.com, you'll find your API key by clicking your email address in the top right, My Profile, and then use the Secret key found under the section entitled "API KEYS".

AcceptOn expects for this super secret API key to be included in all API requests found in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <API KEY>`

For the work efficient types (aka lazy), you can also append your API KEY as a parameter named access_token to any request if modifying headers isn't your thing.

<aside class="notice">
  Remember, you must replace API KEY with your unique Secret API key.

## Transaction tokens
A transaction token is used to allow for details such as the amount to charge,
the currency, and application fee to be created dynamically from a trusted
source. This is to ensure that no tampering has been performed prior to
the charge being completed.

This can either be done one time using the "Create a Form" link after signing
in to https://staging.accepton.com. This is useful for creating a form
with a fixed price.

Or, these tokens can be generated programmatically to support dynamic pricing
using an API client. For instance, this allows for the price and relevant
options to be delayed until the end of the checkout process.
